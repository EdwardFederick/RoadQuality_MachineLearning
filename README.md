# RoadQuality_MachineLearning


The quality of road infrastructure plays a critical role in economic development, public safety, and urban planning. Poor road conditions can lead to increased vehicle maintenance costs, accidents, and inefficient transportation systems. However, manually assessing road quality is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error. This experiment aims to leverage machine learning techniques to automate the process of road quality assessment, making it faster, more accurate, and scalable across large geographic areas.
